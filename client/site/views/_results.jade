  //  p We seamlessly transition between developing for the Browser and Node.js (and sometimes both!)
  //  p We can take advantage of the great extensions and frameworks around Backbone.js
  //  p We can mix-and-match databases to choose the best tool for the job
  //  p We focus on solving problems not memorizing APIs that may differ client/server

  //  p I wrote intial mongodb version and thought I was half way. More like a quarter
  //  p There were many long days and late nights filled with epiphanies: "So that's why A/B/C did X/Y/Z"
  //  p Things like: What do we do when adding related items are not loaded?
  //  p How far do we go to ensure database integrity? (it depends, both is the answer)
