  <!--  p We seamlessly transition between developing for the Browser and Node.js (and sometimes both!)-->
  <!--  p We can take advantage of the great extensions and frameworks around Backbone.js-->
  <!--  p We can mix-and-match databases to choose the best tool for the job-->
  <!--  p We focus on solving problems not memorizing APIs-->

  <h1>We are tired campers!</h1>
  <!--.left-->
  <!--  p Many long days and late nights filled with epiphanies: "So that's why A/B/C did X/Y/Z"-->
  <!--  p Things like: What does a collection mean now in a *to many relation? What do we do when adding items when it's not loaded?-->
  <!--  p What do we do when we set relations before saving them?-->
  <!--  p Is it ok to do some db operations in the background? Or should they be explicit? (it depends, both is the answer)-->
