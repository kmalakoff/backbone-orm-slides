  <h1>Design Goals</h1>
  <h3>AKA: biting the bullet</h3>

  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <div class="left">
    <p>Provide an intuitive query langauge: inspired by the MongoDB gold standard</p>
    <p>Must be Node-y: callback-based queries and promise-based cursors - we got'em!</p>
    <p>Low learning curve: consistent API across Browser and Node.js</p>
    <p>Backbone.js Model and Collection compatible with built-in relationships: we use Knockback.js</p>
    <p>Trivial JSON API generation: raw JSON or DSL to customize</p>
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Above and Beyond</h1>
  <div class="left">
    <p>URL-based query syntax: debug JSON queries on the search bar: wanna debug queries without programming?</p>
    <p>Both JSON and Model interfaces for JSON-only APIs when a full relation, model-based ORM is overkill</p>
    <p>Batch-based, browser-side processing of server models: wanna generate a report in the Browser?</p>
    <p>Node.js-based stream support: wanna stream to JSON from Postgres?</p>
    <p>Relationships in MongoDB: well, it came for free</p>
    <p>In Memory store: great for config file queries</p>
  </div>
