  <h1>Design Goals</h1>
  <h3>AKA: biting the bullet</h3>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <h3>Provide an intuitive query langauge: inspired by the MongoDB gold standard</h3>
  <h3>Must be Node-y: callback-based queries and promise-based cursors - we got'em</h3>
  <h3>Low learning curve: consistent API across Browser and Node.js</h3>
  <h3>Backbone.js Model and Collection compatible with built-in relationships: we use Knockback.js</h3>
  <h3>Trivial JSON API generation: raw or custom JSON DSLs</h3>
</section>

  <h1>Above and Beyond</h1>
  <h3>URL-based query syntax: debug JSON queries on the search bar</h3>
  <h3>JSON and Model interfaces for JSON-only APIs when a full relation, model-based ORM is overkill</h3>
  <h3>Batch-based, browser-side processing of server models</h3>
  <h3>Node.js-based stream support: anyone want to stream JSON from Postgres?</h3>
  <h3>Relationships in MongoDB: it came for free</h3>
  <h3>In Memory store: not all data needs to persist</h3>
